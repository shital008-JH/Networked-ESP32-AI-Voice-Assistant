# 🎙️ Networked ESP32 AI Voice Assistant

An **ESP32-based networked voice assistant** powered by **remote Large Language Model (LLM) inference**.  
This project captures voice input, sends it to a server for AI processing, and returns intelligent responses in real time.

It demonstrates the integration of **Embedded Systems**, **IoT Networking**, and **AI-powered edge devices**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Networked ESP32 AI Voice Assistant** is designed as a smart embedded device capable of voice interaction.

The system workflow:

1. User speaks into the microphone
2. ESP32 captures audio input
3. Audio is transmitted over Wi-Fi to a backend server
4. The server performs AI/LLM-based processing
5. The assistant sends back a response
6. Output is played/displayed in real time
